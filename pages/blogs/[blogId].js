                A CDR is a crucial document that indicates an engineer's skills,
                expertise, qualifications, experience, and competence. Engineers
                who have an overseas qualification and do not possess the
                Washington Accord, Sydney Accord, or Dublin Accord but are
                willing to migrate to Australia to work as skilled engineers
                should first pass the Engineers Australia skill Assessment Test.

                Engineers Australia, an assessing authority, requires a CDR
                document to evaluate your engineering competencies. It is pretty
                standard for CDR to be rejected if they're not prepared as per
                the guidelines prescribed by EA. Many CDR applications are
                rejected yearly due to minor errors in CDR writing. A little
                mistake also makes a huge difference in your CDR assessment. As
                a result, Applicants will be banned for years in a few
                circumstances. If you are very concerned that your report will
                be rejected or denied, it would be best if you could read the
                following points to avoid rejection:

                CDR Writing mistakes omitted by Engineers for Skills Assessment

                Copy-paste content from online sources might jeopardize your
                application for the CDR assessment. Engineers’ Australia
                assessors are highly knowledgeable and are familiar with
                advanced plagiarism detection software like “TURNITIN”. They
                will quickly detect Plagiarised content from your CDR and reject
                your report without Assessment. So, it would be best if you
                could submit your unique CDR report that contains authentic
                information about you, like your knowledge, skills, abilities,
                and work experience.

                Engineers Australia has mentioned complete guidance on the
                migration skills assessment (MSA) booklet regarding CDR
                preparation. In this booklet, all the criteria, structure,
                format, and other essential guidelines are mentioned clearly for
                the CDR report writer to adhere to. There is a chance your CDR
                will be denied even if you have excellent material, abilities,
                expertise, or experience. It would be best if you could prepare
                your report paragraphs with the help of the correct numbering,
                such as 1.1,1.2, and 1.3. There should be Three career Episodes
                with sections and word restrictions. A CDR report must be around
                100-2500 words long.

                English language fluency is essential to passing the test of CDR
                skill assessment. You should compose your CDR content in English
                with no errors or omissions. Your writing skills, tone, and
                knowledge reflect your language proficiency, so it would be good
                if you could write in simple language with no grammatical
                mistakes. Minor mistakes in English also reduce your chances of
